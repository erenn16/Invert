ASSIGNMENT 8 - 2D SPRITE ANIMATION

Game controls are A/Left and D/Right for movement.  Use Space to jump and Shift to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.  Enter doorways to progress to the next room.  Get keys to trigger barriers to move out of your way.

I created the sprite sheet entirely by hand.  The original design was done by Courtney Toder and I manipulated the photoshop file they gave me to create each frame of each animation.  I only have run hooked up at the moment but I think it is a pretty fluid animation.  The animation still works with the code that I have that flips the sprite's color and rotation when the player shifts to the opposite colored area.
