ASSIGNMENT 7 - MOBILE GAME (ANDROID ONLY)

Game controls are the left and right arrows on the screen for movement.  Use either of the up arrows to jump and click on the room to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.  Enter doorways to progress to the next room.  Get keys to trigger barriers to move out of your way.

I tried to think of the best way to layout the controls for adapting Invert to mobile.  Since the game itself is a square I decided to leave it centered and put the controls on either side so as not to overlap the screen.  I decided to lock the game to landscape mode since portrait would have been too cramped for the buttons to feel comfortable.  I added a jump button on both sides so that no one would be inhibited from jumping and moving at the same time.

I've tested this on a Samsung Galaxy S6, but I don't have access to other devices to test how it works on different sized screens.
