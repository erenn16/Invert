INDIVIDUAL GAME MILESTONES 1

Game controls are A/Left and D/Right for movement.  Use Space to jump and Shift to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.

So the basic character movement is done, with the horizontal control, jumping and shifting.  When the character collides with the spikes in the level (or anything else labeled "Deadly"), they will die and have a red particle effect start before restarting the scene.  There is a bug that I've noticed where if you shift the character and run into the spikes, the particle effect doesn't seem to play, and I'm currently working out why that is.  Another known issue is that since I'm using square prefabs to build a level, there are issues with collision where the character can stand on a wall because of Unity's collision detection.  There is a way to solve this, but it involves custom making each wall and ground piece for each level, which would make the level development process that much longer.

I haven't fully designed any levels yet even though it was mentioned in my milestone.  I have a few ideas running in my head for how I want the first few levels.  Level building with my current setup of the building blocks as prefabs would make new level creation really easy.

That's about it for what I have done for this milestone, which is about what I expected I would have done according to my design document.
