FINAL GAME

Game controls are A/Left and D/Right for movement.  Use Space to jump and Shift to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.  Enter doorways to progress to the next room.  Get keys to trigger barriers to move out of your way.

I have a couple more levels added in and an end game scene.  I tried to get enemies in and working but ran into too many issues, so I decided to cut them in the interest of time.  I finally got the canvas in the game to rotate so that the text itself will rotate when the player shifts and doesn't look awkward.  I'm not happy with the animations, but I can't get them to respond as fluidly as I would like.  The animation loops will continue playing even if I've triggered the next state to begin.  Overall, I'm happy with the game and think it came out fairly well.
