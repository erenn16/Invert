INDIVIDUAL MILESTONES 2

Game controls are A/Left and D/Right for movement.  Use Space to jump and Shift to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.  Enter doorways to progress to the next room.  Get keys to trigger barriers to move out of your way.

I am a bit behind in the scheduled milestones I set myself.  I haven't been able to start on the enemy characters as of yet since other parts of the project have been giving me trouble.  I have animations hooked in, though I'm not all that happy with the timing of it yet (sometimes they last too long).  Enemies will definitely come with the final milestone, and a few more levels since I have set up my scenes to be easily manipulated into new arrangements.
