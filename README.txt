ASSIGNMENT 6 - LEVEL DESIGN

Game controls are A/Left and D/Right for movement.  Use Space to jump and Shift to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.  Enter doorways to progress to the next room.  Get keys to trigger barriers to move out of your way.

The level that is for this assignment is in scene Room3 or the spiral looking one in the build.  I have a title scene and 2 "tutorials" before the actual level.


Level Plan:

i. The goal of the player is to get to the doorway and progress to the next room.
ii - v. These can be seen in LevelDemo.mov.  The direct player path is shown, but the user can take less direct ones if they so wish.
vi. There is no music or sounds used in this level.
vii.  There really isn't an interface for the player to use besides seeing the layout of the level.
