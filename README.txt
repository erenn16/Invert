ASSIGNMENT 7 - 2D SPRITE ANIMATION

Game controls are A/Left and D/Right for movement.  Use Space to jump and Shift to invert to the other color layers.  You can kill yourself by moving the character to collide with the spikes.  Enter doorways to progress to the next room.  Get keys to trigger barriers to move out of your way.
